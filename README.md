## What is 'Handshake'?
Handshake is a Java program that allows you transfer files between any two Internet-connected computers without requiring an external file-transfer server to act as intermediate. Light, nimble and multi-platform, Handshake is everything a good, simple file transfer program should be, without being too geeky/nerdy. Also provides solid security measures.

## What will I need for building 'Handshake'?
* JDK 7+
* NetBeans (7+ preferably)
* gnupg-for-java (can be found at [SecureHandshake/gnupg-for-java](https://github.com/SecureHandshake/gnupg-for-java)

## How does this stuff work, anyways?
Handshake uses state of the art PGP encrypton for handling the secure transmission between the computers. It ensures unbreakable security, digital signatures and file integrity.

## Can I use Handshake to send files I don't want my boss/office security/the NSA/my wife to see?
Handshake keys are generated by PGP. If you really need to send such files, make sure you're using a proxy powered by Tor to make life difficult for them. A VPN is not a good idea as the NSA, GCHQ and other agencies have exploited them already-and apart from that, your VPN might be based in the United States or United Kingdom or countries participating in surveillance programs.
And the best you can do to ensure our app works best is have a virus free PC
