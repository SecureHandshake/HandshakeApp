Handshake
=========
Peer-to-peer file transfer. No password/sign-up/storage/website required. Handshake is a Java program that allows you transfer
files between any two Internet-connected computers without requiring an external file-transfer server to act as intermediate.
Light, nimble and multi-platform, Handshake is everything a good, simple file transfer program should be, without being too 
geeky/nerdy. Also provides solid security measures.
