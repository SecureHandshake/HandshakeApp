## What is 'Handshake'?
Handshake is a Java program that allows you transfer files between any two Internet-connected computers without requiring an file-transfer server to act as intermediate. Light, nimble and multi-platform, Handshake is everything a good, simple file transfer program should be, without being too geeky/nerdy.

## What will I need for 'Handshake'?
*Java Runtime installed on your system
*An Internet connection
*Any medium to send your Handshake key to your partner.

## How does this stuff work, anyways?
Try to imagine two mafia gangs meeting, the bosses shaking hands and transfer of money/guns/molotov cocktails taking place. The program generates a Handshake key which you pass on to your partner who's also running Handshake. If the key gets decrypted successfully, a "handshake" takes place and files get transferred. That's it. A Handshake key is valid as long as your Internet connection doesn't get cut or disconnected.

## Can I use Handshake to send files I don't want my boss/office security/the NSA/my wife to see?
Handshake keys are generated by an encryption algorithm based on your IP address. Hence, if you really need to send such files, make sure you're using a proxy powered by Tor to make life difficult for them. A VPN is not a good idea as the NSA, GCHQ and other agencies have exploited them already-and apart from that, your VPN might be based in the United States or United Kingdom or countries participating in surveillance programs.

## I want to contribute to Handshake's development. What will I need?
An IDE is specially recommended (who uses javac from cli nowadays, anyway?). This repository has been specially designed for the NetBeans IDE, though Eclipse/IntelliJ Idea/any good Java IDE will work with this source code as well. Just make sure:
*your IDE has Git integration, or Git is installed in your system
*your IDE is configured to work with projects having Apache's Maven dependency management system
*you are conversant with Google's Java style guidelines
*u can has cheezburger

Get going!
